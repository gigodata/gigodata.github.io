# 🌐 GIGO Data, Inc. – Internal Prototype Portal

This repository powers the private landing site at [https://gigodata.github.io](https://gigodata.github.io), the interface layer for **GIGO Data, Inc.**, a founder-led initiative focused on ethical, auditable, and scalable data governance.

This site is SEO-disabled and bot-blocked — intentionally.  
It’s a live prototype meant for **manual access only** by trusted collaborators and qualified investors.

### 🎯 Purpose

- Showcase our brand identity, design system, and operational aesthetic
- Privately preview performance archives and internal scaffolding
- Signal capability, clarity, and execution — down to the finest detail

Every asset here is intentional: from favicon scaling to the structure of this file.  
We believe great companies are visible in the smallest decisions.
